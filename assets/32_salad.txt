Spiced eggplant salad
This salad is wonderful on a warm day. It is best served at room temperature with buffalo mozzarella or goat's cheese and a dressed handful of peppery rocket. You can salt the eggplants before cooking them but if they are very fresh I don't see the point. The slight bitterness works well against the sweetness of the currants.
Ingredients
100ml olive oil
2 large eggplants, diced into 2cm pieces

8 ripe tomatoes, roughly chopped
1 tsp ground allspice
