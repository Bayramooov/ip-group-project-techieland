Cos lettuce with very useful dressing
This salad dressing gives and gives this holiday season. It is a spectacular dressing, at home pooling between the leaves of icy cold cos as much as it is served with roast chook, roast veg or on leftover ham sandwiches. It makes over a cup, more than you need, but will keep in the fridge for a few days.
Ingredients
4 baby cos, stems removed, halved, washed thoroughly
Dressing
¼ cup creme fraiche
½ cup buttermilk
¼ cup Kewpie mayo
1 cup of dill sprigs, loosely packed, plus a few extra sprigs to serve

salt and pepper to season
