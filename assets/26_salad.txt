Endive salad
I do like the subtle bitterness of the endive, but the endive can be replaced with butter leaf lettuce. This slightly sweet mustard dressing works a treat alongside my comte tart.
Ingredients
4 endives
25g dijon mustard
25g sugar
25g white wine vinegar
50ml grapeseed oil
pinch of salt and white pepper to taste
1 bunch chives, chopped
